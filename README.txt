IMPORTANT:
I'll be moving this mod over to fabric, which should, as ive been told, allow me to develop faster and easier than forge. I also desire the fabric community more as it looks a tad less toxic and much larger than that of forge.
update: forge will continue to be used for development purposes, no promises if it will be supported in 1.17 though

the mod may also be transitioning over to a more nordic/irish/gaelic mythology mod in the future. dragons, selkies, druids, etc. it will still be majorly based around werewolves and lycanthropy the same way ice and fire is based around dragons, but with more tidbits to give things a more mystical feeling! i'll put a link in here once its in alpha and ready for ppl to play with! just stalk this page for when its ready!

Werewolves and werebeasts for MC 1.15.2+
---------------------------------------

   A celtic themed mod created around werebeasts, created and coded by atomicAxolotl,
   apologies for slow/seemingly spaztic development, im still learning and doing this alone.
   (this is my first project on GitHub, i have no idea what im doing.)
   
      if you'd like to help/also become an author, DM me on discord: atomicAxolotl#7064

im just barely learning myself so very little experience or none at all is welcome, as long as you're passionate and also trying to learn i'd be happy 
for whatever help i can get!

      -for explaining various mechanics and furthering lore, gets more pages as the player progresses

   -various ways of contracting lycanthropi

   -werebeasts
      -werewolves, werebears, and perhaps more (outside input welcome)

   -wolfsbane flower and potion
      -potion used to remove all strains of lycanthropi, flower used to make the potion and various other things
      flower prevents wolves from spawning and keeps them at a 5 block distance

      -fae majykk used for various things
      -perhaps like villagers? with trade mechanics and sometimes villages in forests
      
   -kingdoms (neutral party)
      -filled with unique npc villagers
      -trade, go to shops, make friends
      -some oddity shops often spawn in, look for them
      -strong werewolves can recieve quests from the king
      
   -werewolf hunter clans/camps
      -naturally spawning, has a leader you can talk to about becoming a hunter
      -attacks were(beasts) on sight (unless lowlevel and human form, they cant tell then)
      -to eliminate, kill the leader, the hunters will immediately attack
      -the camp, in minecolonies style, can have various buildings upgraded
      -once a hunter: player can join a clan and take quests, climb the ranks to leader, take quests, make friends with the NPC hunters, etc
         OR
      -once player(if hunter) is high enough hunter level, can recruit new hunters to follow or serve them and eventually make their own clan
      -to recruit, they either have to be a good friend of yours or you pay them
      
   -werewolf packs, wild and player made
      -wild packs consist of the 2 alphas and their pups, just like real wolves!
      -a wild pack will have a territory radius of 30 blocks from the den, to remove it you must kill the alphas(parents)
      -will attack the player if they come too close, regardless of alignment
      -at some stage the player(if werewolf) can find and have a mate, with who they can have pups and thus a pack, and set up a territory to gaurd from mobs, other players, and other werewolves
      -level up your pups and mate and take them with you, or keep them home
      -capture other werebeasts and pretty much enslave them, give them jobs
      -make buildings and upgrade them, build a kingdom! become the king/queen of werebeasts! eradicate all hunters!
      -player territory size made based on players werewolf level, up to 200 block radius from den
      
      
and much more! suggestions welcome!
